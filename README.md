# Terraform Provider for Taikun Workshop

## Repo structure

The `workshop/` directory contains the files required at the start of the workshop.
Every participant should be provided with a ZIP archive containing this directory,
as well as the manual corresponding to their OS.

As the Provider is not yet listed on the Terraform registry, the documentation is not available online.
The `docs/` directory thus contains the documentation for the provider in HTML format.
It should be provided to the participants with `docs/index.md` as its starting point.

The LaTex sources for the workshop manuals are located in the `src/` directory.
