\subsection{Task 1}\label{sec:task1}

\begin{note}
For this task, please write your code in the file \texttt{task1.tf}
at the root of the \texttt{workshop/} directory.
\end{note}

Now that we have created our organization,
we will create a Kubernetes profile which belongs to it.
Check the \texttt{kubernetes\_profile} resource's schema on
\href{https://intuinewin.github.io/taikun-docs/resources/kubernetes_profile.html}{the provider's documentation}
and declare the resource in \texttt{task1.tf}, setting \texttt{organization\_id} to the ID
of the organization created in the previous task (see \fullref{sec:task0}).

\begin{warn}
  Remember to follow the \texttt{tfws-<firstname>-<s>} naming convention when naming your Kubernetes profile.
\end{warn}

Once you have declared your resource, apply your changes and move on to the next task.

\begin{tip}
To refer to the ID of your organization, use the following syntax.
\begin{tf}
resource.taikun_organization.myorg.id
\end{tf}
Make sure to replace \texttt{myorg} if you used another label for your organization.
\end{tip}
