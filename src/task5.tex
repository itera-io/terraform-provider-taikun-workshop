\subsection{Task 5}\label{sec:task5}

\begin{note}
For this task, please write your code in the file \texttt{task5.tf}
at the root of the \texttt{workshop/} directory.\\
You will also be editing \texttt{users.tf} and \texttt{users.auto.tfvars}.
\end{note}

Before we can create our first project, we need an access profile.\\

We want our access profile to contain SSH keys for all the users we created in the previous task, \fullref{sec:task4}.
Rather than declare the SSH keys in a separate variable, we will add them to the \texttt{users} variable to
declare them on per user basis.\\

Modify \texttt{users}'s declaration in \texttt{users.tf} to include a list of SSH users per user.
\begin{tf}
variable "users" {
  type = map(object({
    email = string
    role  = string
    ssh_users = list(object({
      name       = string
      public_key = string
    }))
  }))
  description = "List of project users"
  default     = {}
}
\end{tf}

You can now edit \texttt{users.auto.tfvars} and add SSH users to each user.
Considering our previous example of Alice and Bob, here is the same definition of \texttt{users}
with added SSH users.
\begin{tf}
users = {
  "alice" = {
    email = "alice@gmail.com"
    role  = "Manager"
    ssh_users = [
      {
        name       = "alice-work"
        public_key = "ssh-ed25519 AAAATHEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPEDOVERTHELAZYDOG example"
      },
      {
        name       = "alice-home"
        public_key = "ssh-ed25519 AAAATHEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPEDOVERTHELAZYDOG example"
      }
    ]
  },
  "bob" = {
    email = "bob@gmail.com"
    role  = "User"
    ssh_users = [
      {
        name         = "bob-laptop"
        public_key = "ssh-ed25519 AAAATHEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPEDOVERTHELAZYDOG example"
      }
    ]
  },
}
\end{tf}
Add as many SSH users as you wish to the users you defined in the previous task.
Of course, you will need to use valid SSH keys. If you do not wish to create your own,
here is a public key value you can use:
\begin{raw}
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIB/8P0zXmI/Il81+/fnvGrf0X/VyNTrOJ9nQCxBxjc5m taikun
\end{raw}

\begin{warn}
Within one access profile, the names of SSH users must be unique.
\end{warn}

You can now declare the \texttt{taikun\_access\_profile} resource in \texttt{task5.tf}.
You will use \texttt{for\_each} in a slightly different manner as \texttt{ssh\_user} is a nested resource
within the \texttt{access\_profile} resource.
\href{https://intuinewin.github.io/taikun-docs/resources/access_profile.html}{Here}
is the documentation of the access profile resource.\\

The access profile's requirements are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It should use the DNS servers \texttt{8.8.8.8} and \texttt{1.1.1.1}.
  \item It should use the NTP server \texttt{time.windows.com}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tip}
While reading \href{https://intuinewin.github.io/taikun-docs/resources/access_profile.html}{access profile's schema},
you will notice \texttt{dns\_server} and \texttt{ntp\_server} are of the type \textit{Block List}.\\

Going back to the pizza order example, here is how block lists are used.
Suppose the \texttt{pizza\_order} resource has an argument \texttt{extra\_topping} defined as such:
\begin{quote}
- extra\_topping (Block List, Max: 5) List of extra pizza toppings. (see below for nested schema)\\

Nested Schema for extra\_topping\\
Required:\\
- name (String) Name of the extra topping\\
- quantity (Number) Quantity
\end{quote}
Here is how Alice could add mozzarella di bufala and basil to her amatriciana pizza.
\begin{tf}
resource "pizza_order" "orders" {
  client = "alice"
  type   = "amatriciana"
  size   = "large"

  extra_topping {
    name = "basil leaves"
    quantity = 8
  }
  extra_topping {
    name = "bufala slices"
    quantity = 4
  }
}
\end{tf}
\end{tip}
