\subsection{Task 7: Project User Attachments (Bonus)}\label{sec:task7}

\begin{note}
For this task, please write all your code in the file \texttt{task7.tf}
at the root of the \texttt{workshop/} directory.
\end{note}

Now that your project is in \texttt{Ready} state, you can attach some users to it.\\

Declare a \href{https://intuinewin.github.io/taikun-docs/resources/project_user_attachment.html}{project user attachment}
resource with the following \texttt{for\_each} argument, replacing \texttt{<label>} with the label you gave
the \texttt{taikun\_user} resource.
\begin{tf}
  for_each = {
    for user in resource.taikun_user.<label> : user.id => user
    if user.role == "User"
  }
\end{tf}
With this block, you will be able to attach only users with the User role to the project.
To know more about this syntax, see the
\href{https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/expressions/for.html}{documentation on for expressions}.\\

Finally set the proper values for the \texttt{user\_id} and \texttt{project\_id} arguments
and apply your changes.
