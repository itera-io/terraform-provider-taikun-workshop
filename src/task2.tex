\subsection{Task 2}\label{sec:task2}

\begin{note}
For this task, please write your code in the file \texttt{task2.tf}
at the root of the \texttt{workshop/} directory.
\end{note}

We now want to create a Slack configuration, which will be used later
in an alerting profile. \href{https://intuinewin.github.io/taikun-docs/resources/slack_configuration.html}{Here} is its documentation.\\

The hook URL should be \texttt{https://hooks.myapp.example/ci}.
We wish to send \textbf{alert-type notifications only} to the channel \texttt{ci}.

% TODO alerting profile

\begin{warn}
  Remember to follow the \texttt{tfws-<firstname>-<s>} naming convention when naming your resources.
\end{warn}

Once you have declared your two new resources, apply your changes and move on to the next task.
