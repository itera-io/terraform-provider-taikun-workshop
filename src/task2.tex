\subsection{Task 2: Slack Configuration \& Alerting Profile}\label{sec:task2}

\begin{note}
For this task, please write your code in the file \texttt{task2.tf}
at the root of the \texttt{workshop/} directory.
\end{note}

You will now create an alerting profile using a Slack configuration.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Start by declaring a Slack configuration.
  \href{https://registry.terraform.io/providers/itera-io/taikun/latest/docs/resources/slack_configuration}{Here} is its documentation.\\

Its hook URL should be \texttt{https://hooks.myapp.example/ci}.
It must send \textbf{alert-type notifications only} to the channel \texttt{ci}.
  \item You can now declare the alerting profile.
    \href{https://registry.terraform.io/providers/itera-io/taikun/latest/docs/resources/alerting_profile}{Here} is its documentation.\\
    The alerting profile should send notifications \textbf{daily} using the Slack configuration declared above.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{warn}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Remember to follow the \texttt{tfws-<firstname>-<s>} naming convention when naming your resources.
    \item As always, your resources should belong to the organization created in \fullref{sec:task0}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{warn}

Once you have declared these two new resources, apply your changes and move on to the next task.
