\section{Documentation}
Once the provider has been added to the Terraform Registry, the documentation will be available online there.
For the purpose of this workshop, the documentation is being temporarily hosted on \href{https://intuinewin.github.io/taikun-docs/}{Github Pages}.

\section{Tasks}

The \texttt{workshop/} directory has the following content.
\begin{raw}
|-- task_00/
    |-- main.tf
    |-- taikun_credentials.tfvars
    |-- variables.tf
|-- setup.sh*
\end{raw}
Each task has a dedicated directory, when moving on to a new task, please switch into the corresponding directory.

\begin{warn}{Important}
  Throughout this workshop, in order to avoid conflicts and
  to permit easy clean up of leftover infrastructure, please follow the naming conventions used below.\\

  All resources names will follow the format \texttt{tfws-<firstname>-<s>}, where:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{<firstname>} is your firstname
    \item \texttt{<s>} is an arbitrary string of your choosing
  \end{itemize}
  For example, Jane Doe might name their Taikun project \texttt{tfws-jane-mysuperproject}.
\end{warn}

\subsection{Authentication}
In order to complete the tasks that follow, you will need to provide Taikun credentials to Terraform.
You will be using a Partner account, as some of the tasks, such as creating an organization,
require Partner privileges.\\

We will explain how input variables work later in the workshop.
For now, simply edit \texttt{taikun\_auth.auto.tfvars}
and replace the values of \texttt{taikun\_email} and \texttt{taikun\_password}
with the credentials provided on the \textbf{\#terraform-workshop} Slack channel.
\begin{tf}
taikun_email = "jane.doe@itera.io"
taikun_password = "PassWord123"
\end{tf}

\subsection{Task 0}
\begin{note}{Note}
For this task, please switch into the \texttt{task\_00} directory.
