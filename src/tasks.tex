\section{Documentation}
The provider documentation is available on the \href{https://registry.terraform.io/providers/itera-io/taikun/latest/docs}{Terraform Registry}.

\section{Tasks}
The end goal of this workshop is to have an operational Taikun project built solely with Terraform
configuration files.
By following a step by step process, you will discover how various Taikun
resources are declared and managed using Terraform.\\

All your work will be done in the \texttt{workshop/} directory. These are its initial contents.
\begin{raw}
./workshop/
|-- main.tf
|-- taikun_auth.auto.tfvars
|-- variables.tf
\end{raw}
\texttt{main.tf} contains the Provider configuration,
namely its source address and what credentials to use.
You will not need to edit this file.
\begin{tf}
# main.tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    taikun = {
      source = "itera-io/taikun"
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "taikun" {
  email    = var.taikun_email
  password = var.taikun_password
}
\end{tf}
Terraform reads its configuration from all the files with the extension \texttt{.tf},
in the working directory.
Having the provider configuration in \texttt{main.tf} is simply a convention.\\

During this workshop, each task should be coded in a separate config file.
At the end of the workshop, your directory will be organized as such:
\begin{raw}
./workshop/
|-- main.tf
|-- taikun_auth.auto.tfvars
|-- task0.tf
|-- task1.tf
|-- task2.tf
|-- task3.auto.tfvars
|-- task3.tf
|-- task4.tf
|-- task5.tf
|-- task6.tf
|-- task7.tf
|-- variables.tf
|-- users.auto.tfvars
|-- users.tf
\end{raw}

\subsection{Authentication}\label{sec:auth}
In order to complete the tasks that follow, you will need to provide Taikun credentials to Terraform.
You will need a Partner account as some of the tasks, such as creating an organization,
require Partner privileges.\\

Input variables will be explained later in the workshop.
For now, simply edit \texttt{taikun\_auth.auto.tfvars}
and replace the values of \texttt{taikun\_email} and \texttt{taikun\_password}
with your credentials.
\begin{tf}
# taikun_auth.auto.tfvars
taikun_email = "jane.doe@itera.io"
taikun_password = "PassWord123"
\end{tf}
