\section{Setup}

You can choose to install Terraform and the Taikun provider on your machine and
then download the workshop files.
However, if you wish to use the prebuilt Docker image which already contains
the workshop files, skip ahead to \fullref{sec:docker}.

\subsection{Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item You must have Terraform version 0.14 or newer installed.
  \item To clone the required repositories, you need to join Itera's \href{https://github.com/itera-io}{GitHub organization}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Installing Terraform}
You can install Terraform using one of the popular package managers, or manually by
download the binary.
\subsubsection{Homebrew on MacOS}
\begin{shell}
brew tap hashicorp/tap
brew update
brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
\end{shell}

\subsubsection{Apt on Ubuntu or Debian}
\begin{shell}
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common curl
curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-add-repository \
"deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com `lsb_release -cs` main"
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install terraform
\end{shell}

\subsubsection{Pacman on Archlinux}
\begin{shell}
sudo pacman -S terraform
\end{shell}

\subsubsection{Manually}
Download the proper package from the \href{https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html}{Download Terraform page}
and unzip it to extract the \texttt{terraform} binary.
Then place the binary in your \texttt{PATH}.\\

Run the following command to display a colon-separated list of directories in your \texttt{PATH}.
\begin{shell}
echo $PATH
\end{shell}
This might output the following.
\begin{raw}
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/site_perl
\end{raw}
Place the \texttt{terraform} binary in one of the listed directories (avoid putting it in \texttt{/usr/bin} or \texttt{/usr/local/sbin} if you can).
For example:
\begin{shell}
sudo mv ~/Downloads/terraform /usr/local/bin/
\end{shell}

\subsection{Installing the Taikun provider}
Until the provider is listed on Terraform's \href{https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers}{plugin registry},
the provider must be installed locally.\\

Start by cloning its GitHub repo.
\begin{shell}
git clone git@github.com:itera-io/terraform-provider-taikun.git
\end{shell}
Then run the following commands to install the provider on your machine.
\begin{shell}
cd terraform-provider-taikun
make dockerinstall
\end{shell}
The provider will be installed at the following location.\\
\texttt{~/.terraform.d/plugins/itera-io/dev/taikun/0.1.0/linux\_amd64/terraform-provider-taikun}.

\subsection{Downloading the workshop files}
Terraform config files with the minimal required configuration are provided for each task.
Download the \texttt{workshop.zip} file from the Slack channel \textbf{\#terraform-workshop}
and extract its contents in the directory of your choice.\\
